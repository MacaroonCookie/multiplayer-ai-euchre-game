## Purpose of the Program ##
The purpose of creating this Euchre program is for me to practice the application of familiar Java and object oriented concepts while discovering unfamiliar concepts in the process.  My goal is to widen my programming knowledge and experience.

This program will also be available to those who wish to learn about programming concepts as well.  This is a 'discovery' project, it is meant to educate others as well as myself.


## Plan of Developing the Program ##
My plan is to first build a basic, console-based card game to practice familiar concepts and fully understand their uses.  Once the first version of the game is made, I will develop a GUI card table to play the game.  From there, I will begin developing networking capabilities for multi-player gaming, followed by creating a dynamic system to allow others to submit AI codes to play the game.


## Expected Program Features in v1.0 ##
  * Console based
  * Basic AI players
  * Single player
  * Fully functioning card system
  * Scoring capabilities
  * Teams
  * Trump Implementation
  * Kidi Implementation
  * Dynamic card classes (Deck, hand, kidi, played cards)


## Predicted Program Features ##
  * AI players
  * Fully functional scoring system
  * Multi-player capabilities on local machines
  * Multi-player capabilities over networks
  * Chat system (w/ table talk prevention?)
  * Full GUI system
  * Stats and Ranking system (S&R)
